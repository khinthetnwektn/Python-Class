#Loops

-Whie Loops
-for Loops

Condition is true, while loop execute a set of statements

x = 1
while X < 7:
	print(x)
	x += 1



While loop requires a variable ready.

x = 1
while x < 7:
	print(x)
	if x == 5:
		break
	x +=1

==================================================

For Loops

#for loop is iterating over a sequence

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "pineapple", "coconut", "cucumber"]
for x in fruits:
	print(x)

#Looping in a String

for x in "pineapple":
	print(x)

#The break Statement

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "pineapple", "coconut", "cucumber"]
for x in fruits:
	print(x)
	if x == "pineapple":
		break


-----

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "pineapple", "coconut", "cucumber"]
for x in fruits:
	if x == "pineapple":
		break
	print(x)

# The continue Statement - stop the current iteration

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "pineapple", "coconut", "cucumber"]
for x in fruits:
	if x == "banana":
		print(x)
			continue
		if x == "coconut":
			continue
	print(x)


#The range() function - a set of code a specified number of times

for x in range(10):
	print(x)

for x in range(10, 100):
	print(x)

for x in range(10, 100, 5):
	print(x)


#nested loops

NumberA = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
NumberB = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for x in NumberA:
	for y in NumberB:
		print(x,y)

for x in range(1, 6):
	for y in range(1, 6):
		print(x, y)


#Pass

for x in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
	pass

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "pineapple", "coconut", "cucumber"]
for x in fruits:
	if x == "pineapple":
		pass
	print(x)

words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenstrate']
for w in words:
	print(w,  len(w))

-------

for n in range(2, 10):
	for x in range(2, n):
		if n % x == 0:
			print(n, 'equals', x, '*', n//x)
			break
	else:
		#loop fell through without finding a factor
		print(n, 'is a prime number')

for num in range(2, 10):
	if num % 2 == 0:
		print("Found an even number", num)
		continue
	print("Found a number", num)
